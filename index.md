Hi, I am Felix Geisend√∂rfer, a programmer and entrepreneur living in Berlin,
Germany.

Currently I'm writing software in [Go](http://golang.org/) as a contractor.

In the past I've co-founded and bootstrapped
[Transloadit](http://transloadit.com/) into a profitable business, was one of
the first contributors to [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and worked on many
other [open source projects](http://github.com/felixge) as well.

One of my spare time passions is robotics, so [a few
friends](http://nodecopter.com/core) and I organized an event around
programming flying robots with JavaScript called
[NodeCopter](http://nodecopter.com/) which has now turned into a small
community.

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/felixge) and
[github](https://github.com/felixge), or [contact me](#contact) directly.

After speaking a little too much in 2012, I've heavily cut down on events, but
I still enjoy speaking ocassionally, so [reach out](#contact) if you'd like to
invite me to an event.

You can reach me at [hi@felixge.de](mailto:hi@felixge.de).

I love meeting new people, so if you're in Berlin, I'm almost always up for
having lunch or coffee - just get in touch!

Please use Github for any questions or bug reports concerning my open source
projects, this way the information can become useful to everybody.

I try to answer all e-mails, but sometimes I have a bit of a backlog.
