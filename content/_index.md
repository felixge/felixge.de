Hi, I am Felix Geisend√∂rfer, a programmer and entrepreneur living in Berlin,
Germany.

Currently I'm writing software in [Go](http://golang.org/) as a contractor.

In the past I've co-founded and bootstrapped
[Transloadit](http://transloadit.com/) into a profitable business, was one of
the first contributors to [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and worked on many
other [open source projects](http://github.com/felixge) as well.

One of my spare time passions is robotics, so [a few
friends](http://nodecopter.com/core) and I organized an event around
programming flying robots with JavaScript called
[NodeCopter](http://nodecopter.com/) which has now turned into a small
community.

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/felixge) and
[github](https://github.com/felixge), or [contact me](#contact) directly.
